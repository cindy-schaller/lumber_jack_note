LumberJack::Note
=====================
This plugin installs a polymorphic Note model into your application.
After it is installed, you will be able to associate multiple Notes with
any model in your application. You will also have a polymorphic controller and
views to re-use on all of your associated models.

In addition to associating several Notes with your Model, you will also
gain some helper methods to manage Model and Notes. Here is a brief
example:

organization.rb:
---------------
  class Organization < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many_notes
  end

Your Organization model now has the usual 'has_many' functionality plus some
additional methods:

  Organization.find_all_by_note('number') => array of Organization models for that
  'number'.
  o = Organization.find(1)
  o.note_for('title') => The note object for that 'title'.
  o.note_for_title => The same thing called differently
  o.note_best => The note object that you have sorted to the top of the list.

routes.rb:
---------
  map.resources :people, :has_many => :notes

Your OrganizationController now has access to the polymorphic NotesController
and the views required to manage Notes for people.

Plugin Installation for a brand new project:
===========================================
0)  Rails 2.3.2 or higher & SQLite3!
1)  Create a new rails project: 'rails test_note'

      has_many_notes #(Put it right after the class definition)
9)  Move 'views/layouts/organizations.html.erb' to
      'views/layouts/application.html.erb'
      (Not sure why Rails does not create this file)
10) Delete 'views/layouts/organizations.html.erb'
      & 'views/layouts/people.html.erb'
11)  Modify 'views/layouts/application.html.erb' to include this in the

        <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
12)  Modify 'config/routes.rb' as follows:

      map.resources :people, :has_many => :notes
      map.root :controller => "organizations"
13) Delete 'public/index.html'
14) Add this partial reference to 'app/views/organizations/show.html.erb':
    <%= render :partial => 'notes/list',
      :locals => {:notable => @organization} %>
15) Add this partial reference to 'app/views/people/show.html.erb':
    <%= render :partial => 'notes/list',
      :locals => {:notable => @person} %>
16) rake db:create
17) rake db:migrate
18) script/server
19) Create an Organization and a Organization then add some notes for each
20) Use script/console to check out some methods that the plugin adds to your
    models:
  Model.find_all_by_note('title') => array of Models for that number
  p = Model.find(1)
  p.note_for('title') => The note object for that 'title'.
  p.note_for_title => The same thing called differently
  p.note_best => The note object that you have sorted to the top of the list.
